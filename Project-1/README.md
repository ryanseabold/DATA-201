# Project 1

### Global Spice Production and Consumption

This project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle titled "[Global Spice Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishthakur995/global-spice-consumption)," derived from FAOSTAT, the statistical database of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The dataset contains 45,321 observations and 13 variables, of which 45,042 observations and 7 variables are selected for analysis. The relevant variables include: territory, spice, year, import amount, export amount, production amount, and estimated consumption.

The dataset offers a structured view of global spice trade and consumption trends from 1993 to 2023, with domestic consumption estimated using the formula:

**Consumption = Production + Import - Export**

Spices covered include raw anise, coriander, cumin, caraway, fennel, and juniper berries; dry chilies and peppers; green chilies and peppers; raw cinnamon and cinnamon flowers; raw cloves (whole stems); raw ginger; raw nutmeg, mace, and cardamoms; raw pepper; and raw vanilla.

This dataset was compiled by Kaggle user [Gambler](https://www.kaggle.com/harishthakur995) (harishthakur995). It was published on 24 March 2025.

### Research Questions

-   Which countries are the largest consumers of specific spices?

-   How does spice production relate to spice consumption?

-   How do import/export ratios influence domestic consumption trends?

## Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Ensure `Spice.csv` is in the same directory as `project.ipynb`.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.
